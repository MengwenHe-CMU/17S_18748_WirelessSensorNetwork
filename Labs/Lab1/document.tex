\subsection{Compute Path Loss Exponent $n$}

Path loss exponent is given by: $$L=10n\log_{10}d+C$$
\begin{itemize}
	\item $L$: path loss
	\item $n$: path loss exponent
	\item $d$: distance in meters
	\item $C$: system constant
\end{itemize}

From two different data points: $$(L2-L1)=10n\log_{10}(d2/d1) \Rightarrow n=(L2-L1)/(10\log_{10}(d2/d1))$$

As RSSI is linearly related to path loss $$(L2-L1)=(RSSI2-RSSI1)$$

Fix $d1=4.57$, $L1=24$ and get the estimation as Tab.\ref{tab:pathloss}:

\begin{table}[!h]
	\centering
	\caption{The Estimation of Path Loss Exponent}
	\label{tab:pathloss}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		$d2$	&	$L2$	&	$n$	\\
		\hline
		9.14		&	18		&	-1.993	\\
		\hline
		13.72		&	15		&	-1.885	\\
		\hline
		18.29		&	12		&	-1.992	\\
		\hline
		22.86		&	0		&	-3.433 (invalid)	\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Because we cannot get RSSI value when $d2=22.86$, we cannot trust this measurement that just represents the margin of the signal coverage. Therefore, the estimated Path Loss Exponent is:
$$\mathbb{E}[n]=\frac{-1.993-1.885-1.992}{3}=-1.957$$
$$Var[n]=\frac{(1.957-1.993)^2+(1.957-1.885)^2+(1.957-1.992)^2}{3}=0.0039$$
$$\sigma=\sqrt{Var[n]}=0.0621$$

\end{figure}

\subsection{Worst-case Response Time Estimation}

Because the task1 and task2 are released every 1s and 2s, we can directly get their response time from the nanosecond part, and thus easily get the worst-case response time as below:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Case 1:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Task1: 601562808
		\item Task2: 299804841
	\end{itemize}
	\item Case 2:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Task1: 298828278
		\item Task2: 601562808
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Explanation of The Differences}

\subsubsection{Response Time}

For case1, because task1 has lower priority, it will be preempted by task2 every 2 seconds; therefore, the response time of task1 is not stable. For case2, because task1 has higher priority, it will not be preempted by task2; therefore, the response time of task1 is stable.

For task2, because its period interval is longer than task1's, and they form a harmonized taskset; therefore, task2's response time is stable for both cases.

\subsubsection{Worst-case Response Time}

Comparing the worst-case response time of task1 and task2 from two cases, we found that the task with higher priority will have smaller worst-case response time.

\subsection{Bonus1: Find a tight CPU reserve budget for each task.}

From the experiment, we know that if task1 with shorter period interval has higher priority, both tasks can have stable response time; therefore, our method is first to use the RMS(Rate-monotonic scheduling) to assign the priority to each task, and then assign each task's reserve budget equals to its worst-case response time.
